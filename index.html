        <h3>Is it really true that you're just 15 years old?</h3>
        <span class="toggle-btn">+</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes, I’m 15 years old. I started learning HTML, CSS and javaScript out of curiosity when I was just a kid. Over time, I fell in love with web development and kept exploring more advanced tools like JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and React. Even though I’m still a student, I’ve spent countless hours building projects, solving problems, and constantly improving my skills. Age doesn’t stop me — I believe in showing what I can do through my work.</p>

        <h3>Do you work as a freelancer professionally?</h3>
        <span class="toggle-btn">+</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Not yet. Right now, I’m focused on building high-quality web templates and getting success on ThemeForest. Once I establish myself there, I plan to expand into freelancing platforms like Fiverr, LinkedIn, Upwork, and Freelancer.com. I want to build a strong portfolio first so that when I enter freelancing, I can showcase solid work and attract serious clients.</p>

    <!-- faq 3 qustion and answer -->

      <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>What are your future goals as a developer?</h3>
        <span class="toggle-btn">+</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>My first goal is to get success on ThemeForest by selling high-quality templates. Once I achieve that, I’ll start working on platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, and LinkedIn to offer freelance services. In the long run, I aim to become a full-stack developer by learning backend technologies like Node.js and MongoDB. Eventually, I want to create digital products, contribute to open-source, and even build my own web-based tools or services.</p>

    <!-- faq 4 qustion and answer -->
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>Do you work with any team or are you a solo developer?</h3>
        <span class="toggle-btn">+</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>I currently work solo. Every project in my portfolio has been fully developed by me — from planning the layout to writing the final line of code. I enjoy the process of working independently because it helps me learn faster and take full control over design, structure, and performance. However, I’m also open to collaboration in the future when I start freelancing or work with clients or teams on larger projects.</p>

    <!-- faq 5 qustion and answer -->
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>Is the education name shown in your portfolio real?</h3>
        <span class="toggle-btn">+</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>No, the name is not real. I’m currently a student of class 9 in 2025, and I’ve chosen not to display my actual school name publicly for privacy reasons. The name shown in my portfolio is just a placeholder. My main focus here is to highlight my web development skills, real projects, and what I’m capable of building — not to promote my academic background. I believe my work speaks louder than titles.</p>
